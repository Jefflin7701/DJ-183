### Why DJ 183?
We love music, and the thought of creating a website really appealed to us because we constantly use websites in our everyday lives. DJ 183 would be a good chance to learn more coding, practice what we already know, and learn about web design.

### Previous Web Experience
None

### Overall Project Description
We are planning on using the Bootstrap library to make additional styling features to our website, such as a moving background, aesthetic typography, and a clean, easy-to-navigate layout/user interface. Along with cleaning up the styling, we are also planning to add additional pages such as an "about the creators" page and "behind the scenes" page. We would also like to implement social sharing features so that people can share the website and their scores on various social media platforms. We also plan on utilizing databases to implement a leaderboard, so that top scores can be tracked. Additionally, we would like to make the website interface fully responsive to different browser sizes and devices.

### Group Logistics
We will complete this project mostly as a group, meeting up 3 times a week during late afternoons/evenings. If we don’t finish the work we planned to do for a particular day or have extra things to do, we will work these out separately and discuss at the next meeting. We will communicate through SMS group chat. We will decide how to split up the responsibilities on the first meeting, with the goal of equally distributing the work, considering everyone’s strengths/weaknesses, and considering the times when each person is busy.
